Varnish
=======

This plugin provides helpers to interract with the Varnish proxy.
It aims at covering two parts:
- the purge of a cached page/action.
- the use of ESI includes from Rails (within the light scope of varnish esi support)


Example
=======

- Remotely expire page '/example/test' from a controller/sweeper (happens to expire also the cached page if rails cache enabled)
expire_page('/example/test')

- Remotely expire action '/example/test' from a controller/sweeper (happens to expire also the cached action if rails cache enabled)
expire_action('/example/test')
	
- Adding an ESI include with a time to live of 10 seconds in a Rails view
<%= render :esi => time_now_path(:format => :esi), :ttl => 10 %>

Setup
======

script/install git://github.com/hellvinz/varnish_rails.git

Edit RAILS_ROOT/config/varnish.yml to reflect your varnish installation

Adapt your varnish installation to allow:
- purge from the rails host (http://varnish.projects.linpro.no/wiki/VCLExamplePurging)
- esi http://varnish.projects.linpro.no/wiki/ESIfeatures

That's all.
